## Hackathon Project by Seth Mitchell & Steve Larsen
***Built with GraphQL & StepZen***

This dashboard is the result of a week-long hackathon to explore and learn about GraphQL and work alongside the team at StepZen.  

StepZen lets you create, deploy, and host a GraphQL API with just a single command that your frontend can consume. You can connect to databases, content management systems, and traditional REST APIs all from a single schema.  

With implementing their technologies, we were able to build a comprehensive and dynamic launch dashboard utilizing SpaceX's API with minimal code using **super-cool** materializers to pare back and condense queries to only necessary response data.
